# SaaS-Tech-Start-Up IAM
 
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I played a critical role in defining the Identity and Access Management (IAM) strategy for a startup organization. My responsibilities included identifying business and regulatory requirements, defining IAM policies and standards, and developing a comprehensive IAM roadmap. Throughout the project, I worked closely with stakeholders to ensure that the IAM controls I implemented effectively enforced the policies and met the organization's security goals. Through my efforts, the startup was able to establish a strong foundation for managing identities and access to its critical systems and data.
